## Ideation

1. What is your idea?

- Give it a cool name -> chatStories
- Describe it in one line -> simple crud app for users on creative collabrative content creation
- Come up with analogies -> tiktok/youtube for users that likes writing/reading
- Are there existing versions of this out there? -> plentiful... i believed...

2. What are your features?

- What can the user do? -> user1 creates a 40 words (max) paragraph, passed to other users (maybe user22?, maybe user10?) that is interested to carry on writing and so on and so forth...

* Why does this need to exist? -> another platform for writers/readers that loves words content (as opposed to motion content) ??? not sure, just my thought...
* What sort of information do you need to create this app?
* Is it all user-entered? -> it will be intensively based on user inputs
* Will you be getting info from elsewhere? -> brother google and sister youtube
* What APIs will you be using? -> self api... perhaps... maybe... very likely...
* How will you store your data? Do you (really) need login functionality?
  - -> single user demo in MVP will not require login but will require for multiuser inputs demo
  - -> sqlite
  - -> python flask api
  - -> will very likely to run local dev with actual andriod mobile device (similar to my submission in PCMOB6)
